						<h4>Westermo Research &amp; Development <small>2011 - 2012</small></h4>
					</div>
					<div class="span8 justify">
						<p>Developed new functionality for Westermo's network operating system for their high-end rugged routers and switches. Work mostly consisted of adapting open source packages and integrating them in to WeOS's configuration interfaces. Packages include web servers, routing protocol daemons and various other L2/L3 protocols. Taught me a lot about how to structure large code bases and expanded my knowledge about several network protocols.</p>
						
						<p>Had a large part in the design and development of the latest generation of an automated test system. The system performs hundreds of functional tests on multiple products every night and it is also available to the developers during the day. Gave me the opportunity to solidify my knowledge of the Python language.</p>
						
						<p>In addition, I have worked on some smaller projects such as USB memory firmware and a report/control system for the previously mentioned test system using a combination of Python/HTML/CSS/JS.</p>

						<p>Linux consultant and developer of a radio modem using Software Defined Radio (SDR) techniques. My primary task was to develop a complete board support package including toolchain, bootloader, kernel, device drivers and user-space environment for the device's ARM processor. Also assisted in porting the customers proprietary radio link protocol. A great experience that gave me a great understanding of how all the pieces in a complete product works together.</p>
						
						<p>Being the only one on the team with any previous Linux experience meant that I was responsible for training and mentoring of the other team members. This was accomplished mostly through a continuous dialogue about difficulties that are met in the day-to-day work; but I also held a formal three day course on embedded Linux.</p>  
						
						<p>Implemented the GMSK modulator and demodulator of the raw baseband signal which runs on a Ti C64x DSP processor. A challenging task that combined signal and transform theory with vector operations and cache optimizations.</p>

						<p>The objective was to investigate wether or not an existing product would benefit from using a real-time hardened Linux kernel in place of Windows CE. In particular there where some real-time constraints on the CAN and I2C communication stacks.</p>
						
						<p>Developed a Linux board support package for the device using the PREEMPT_RT patch set along with the required drivers. I was then able to show that the kernel could sustain the needed response times, even under a high system load.</p>

						<p>The original task was to fix some performance issues when writing writing data out to a CompactFlash card on a PowerPC based video recording platform running Linux. After thorough investigations in to the problem, I was able to show that the problem was related to a particular brand of CF memories and that the bottleneck was not in the software.</p>
						
						<p>As a continuation of the project I upgraded the system's kernel from an ancient 2.4 kernel to a modern 2.6 kernel. Also updated the bootloader and rewrote some proprietary drivers to use standard Linux functionality to interface the video recording platform. This solved issues with audio and video being recorded out of sync during long recordings.</p>

						<p>Master's thesis which investigated what sort of hard real-time requirements could be acchieved on a Linux based embedded system. Three different solutions where put to the test when their interrupt and scheduling latencies where measured using a custom external test tool. One solution, Xenomai, used a micro kernel approach, where all real-time tasks where run with a higher priority than the Linux kernel. Another, the PREEMPT_RT patch set, modified some fundamental kernel subsystems, tuning them for higher determinism. As a reference, an unmodified Linux kernel was also put through the test.</p>
						
						<p>Measurements where performed under various degrees of load, and the results where presented in the report &quot;Performance Evaluation of GNU/Linux for Real-Time Applications&quot;. The report is available at <a href="http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:158978/FULLTEXT01">uu.diva-portal.org</a>.</p>
