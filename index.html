	  <p>
	    Developed new functionality for Westermo's network
	    operating system for their high-end rugged routers and
	    switches. Work mostly consisted of adapting open source
	    packages and integrating them in to WeOS's configuration
	    interfaces. Packages include web servers, routing
	    protocol daemons and various other L2/L3
	    protocols. Taught me a lot about how to structure large
	    code bases and expanded my knowledge about several
	    network protocols.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Had a large part in the design and development of the
	    latest generation of an automated test system. The
	    system performs hundreds of functional tests on multiple
	    products every night and it is also available to the
	    developers during the day. Gave me the opportunity to
	    solidify my knowledge of the Python language.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    In addition, I have worked on some smaller projects such
	    as USB memory firmware and a report/control system for
	    the previously mentioned test system using a combination
	    of Python/HTML/CSS/JS.

	  <p>
	    Linux consultant and developer of a radio modem using
	    Software Defined Radio (SDR) techniques. My primary task
	    was to develop a complete board support package including
	    toolchain, bootloader, kernel, device drivers and
	    user-space environment for the device's ARM
	    processor. Also assisted in porting the customers
	    proprietary radio link protocol. A great experience that
	    gave me a great understanding of how all the pieces in a
	    complete product works together.
	  </p>
	    
	  <p>
	    Being the only one on the team with any previous Linux
	    experience meant that I was responsible for training and
	    mentoring of the other team members. This was accomplished
	    mostly through a continuous dialogue about difficulties
	    that are met in the day-to-day work; but I also held a
	    formal three day course on embedded Linux.
	  </p>
	    
	  <p>
	    Implemented the GMSK modulator and demodulator of the raw
	    baseband signal which runs on a Ti C64x DSP processor. A
	    challenging task that combined signal and transform theory
	    with vector operations and cache optimizations.

	    The objective was to investigate wether or not an existing
	    product would benefit from using a real-time hardened
	    Linux kernel in place of Windows CE. In particular there
	    where some real-time constraints on the CAN and I2C

	  <p>
	    Developed a Linux board support package for the device
	    using the PREEMPT_RT patch set along with the required
	    drivers. I was then able to show that the kernel could
	    sustain the needed response times, even under a high
	    system load.

	    The original task was to fix some performance issues when
	    writing writing data out to a CompactFlash card on a
	    PowerPC based video recording platform running
	    Linux. After thorough investigations in to the problem, I
	    was able to show that the problem was related to a
	    particular brand of CF memories and that the bottleneck
	    was not in the software.
	  </p>
	    
	  <p>
	    As a continuation of the project I upgraded the system's
	    kernel from an ancient 2.4 kernel to a (at the time)
	    modern 2.6 kernel. Also updated the bootloader and rewrote
	    some proprietary drivers to use standard Linux
	    functionality to interface the video recording
	    platform. This solved issues with audio and video being
	    recorded out of sync during long recordings.

	    Master's thesis which investigated what sort of hard
	    real-time requirements could be acchieved on a Linux based
	    embedded system. Three different solutions where put to
	    the test when their interrupt and scheduling latencies
	    where measured using a custom external test tool. One
	    solution, Xenomai, used a micro kernel approach, where all
	    real-time tasks where run with a higher priority than the
	    Linux kernel. Another, the PREEMPT_RT patch set, modified
	    some fundamental kernel subsystems, tuning them for higher
	    determinism. As a reference, an unmodified Linux kernel
	    was also put through the test.

	    Measurements where performed under various degrees of
